# HR_Analytics_Dashboard_Report
This project follows an end-to-end HR analytics workflow where the data was first processed and filtered using Python libraries such as Pandas and NumPy in Google Colab. 
The cleaned HR dataset was then imported from Excel/CSV into a PostgreSQL database to ensure structured storage and efficient querying. After validating the data using SQL, the database was connected to Power BI for visualization.
An interactive HR Analytics Dashboard was developed in Power BI to analyze employee attrition, average age, salary, tenure, and workforce distribution across departments, job roles, education levels, age groups, and gender. 
This dashboard enables HR teams to gain actionable insights, identify attrition trends, and support data-driven decision-making for employee retention and workforce planning.
